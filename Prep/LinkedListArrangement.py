QUESTION -
We were given a linked list and we had to segregate its even and odd position
nodes in such a way that odd position nodes before even positioned nodes and
even positioned nodes had to be appended after odd positioned nodes but in a
reverse order.

Ex – linked list: – 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6
Output: – 1 -> 3-> 5 -> 6 -> 4-> 2.
